# DNA-Classification-using-Different-Models

### You will learn how to:

"* Import data from the UCI repository
"* Convert text inputs to numerical data
"* Build and train classification algorithms
"* Compare and contrast classification algorithms



##### Applying  ten different models to classify the dataset obtained from UCI for the neucloides for the DNA per sequence and  came up with the result that which classifier is having maximum accuracy and perform well throughout the model.
